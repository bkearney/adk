This is some initial thinking around an appliance development kit.
It is very rudimentary, and requires checkouts of the latest
bits to function. But.. it is good enough to be criticized.

SETUP
=====
* yum install rubygem-rake git hg
* Install the ami tools from http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=368
* change to the ADK_HOME directory
* rake setup
* copy adk.yml.example ot adk.yml
* edit the adk.yml file for more settings
* su to root
* change to the ADK_HOME directory
* . ./adk.rc


RUNNING
=======
Now you can run it. Some things you can do:
 
adk build [APPLIANCE] : Builds the appliance
adk ec2 [APPLIANCE] [BUCKET] : Takes the output of build, and bundles it as an AMI, and pushes it to S3
adk vmx [APPLIANCE] : Takes the output of the build, and converts it to a vmware appliance.
adk cobbler [APPLIANCE] : Takes the output of build, and puhes it as an image into cobbler


NOTES / GOTCHAS
===============
* The cobbler integration is pending a patch being commited in the ruby bindings. It will fail now.
* After you run ec2, you will need to register the manifest to create the AMI. 
* The tool uses make to do dependency management. So, it will not rebuild the image if the kickstart file
  is unchanged. If you change the underlieing rpms you will need to use the --fo
